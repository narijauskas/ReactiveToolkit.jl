#TODO: Timer, every, kill!


# Signals (construction, notification, value)
# Timers (construction, notification, taskdaemon)
# ReactiveTasks (id, status, stop!(id))
# graph/overview display (link implicit connections manually)


#= Issues:
    - how to handle Signals of Signals? (forbid)
    - how to schedule MIMO tasks?
    - how to handle external inputs (eg. recv(UDPSocket))
        - maybe with a trait? Reactivity? Observability? Detectable?
